## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a library for easy work with the VK API. It contains all the standard queries that are defined by VK. This makes it easier to access LongPollServer VK.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Steps:
1. Copy this repository to your computer;
2. Open terminal in a directory where you copied the repository;
3. Change a main directory: `cd build`;
4. Enter the following command with your replacements: `cmake -DNLOHMANN_JSON_PATH=PATH:*path* -DCURL_INCLUDE_PATH=PATH:*path* -DCURL_LIB_PATH=PATH:*path*..`. Replace the `*path*` inserts with the corresponding paths;
5. Build the project by the command: `cmake --build .`;
6. If installing is ended successfully you can see in the directory `build` include's files and libs;

### Prerequisites

The library using 2 additional dependencies:
1. [curlpp](https://www.curlpp.org/) - A library for working with requests;
2. [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) - A library for working with json.

Note that you also can install it by `vcpkg` on Windows.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
