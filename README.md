## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a library for easy work with the VK API. It contains all the standard queries that are defined by VK. This makes it easier to access LongPollServer VK.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Steps:
1. Copy this repository to your computer;
2. Open terminal in a directory where you copied the repository;
3. Enter the following command: `cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .`;
4. If installing is ended successfully you can see in the directory `build` the following files:
  1. `include/` - the directory with include's files;
  2. 'lib/' - the static libs.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be
